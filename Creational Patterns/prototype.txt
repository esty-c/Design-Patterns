Shallow cloning and Deep cloning

The cloning of the object can be divided into two categories:

    Shallow Cloning: In shallow cloning non static fields of the current object is copied in the new object. 
	For the value type fields bit-by-bit copy of field is performed. For the reference type field, the reference/ address is copied but the referred object is not; so, both the original and cloned object will refer to the same instance of reference type fields.
	In C#, shallow cloning is performed using MemberWiseClone method.
	
	
    Deep Cloning: Deep cloning basically duplicates everything.
	In deep cloning, both value type and reference type are copied in cloned object; original and cloned objects becomes two distinct object. 
	So if cloned object instance is modified there will be no change in original object.
