Going by its name, we can say that observer is something (objects in case of OOPS) which is looking upon (observing) other object(s). 
Observer pattern is popularly known to be based on "The Hollywood Principle" which says- "Don’t call us, we will call you.
" Pub-Sub (Publisher-Subscriber) is yet another popular nickname given to Observer pattern.

Based on the "Hollywood principle", we can make a guess that in observer pattern, there is a special Hollywood celebrity object in which all other common objects are interested.

Purpose of Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is to notify the interested observers about some change occurred. We can add more observers in runtime as well as remove them.

Example: We have a form to select the color. 
For each color change we need to update the entire application. There will be observers listening to the color change event for updating themselves.
